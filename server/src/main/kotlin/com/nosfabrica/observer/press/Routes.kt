 *
 * THERE IS NO `url` HERE, and the absence is the point. It used to carry
 * `servers.first() + "/" + hash`, assembled here — the same guess this codebase
 * had already caught itself making at upload, where BUD-02 hands back the URL
 * and `blossom.primal.net` hands back one with `.html` on the end. At upload
 * the fix was to take the descriptor's URL. There is no descriptor to take one
 * from here: a manifest names servers and a hash, and the descriptor was a
 * response to a request made on a different day, which we deliberately do not
 * store.
 *
 * So the honest options were a link that may 404 or no link, and now that
 * `/api/archive/{day}/view` reads the edition properly there is nothing for a
 * guessed one to do. `Blossom.fetch` builds the same `server + "/" + hash` to
 * FETCH with — but it checks what comes back against the signed hash, tries the
 * next server when one fails, and says which ones did. That is a guess that
 * catches itself. Handing the same string to a reader as a link is not.
